# Mark's Kitchen - A True Culinary Experience

[Please see my live app here!](https://marks-kitchen.herokuapp.com/)

## 1. Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project was to design a website which allowed a user to register for an account, book a meal in a restaurant on a particular date at a particular time and allow all users to post reviews that could be seen by all visitors of the site.

This project was my first time developing with the Django framework and was a huge undertaking for me, grasping the basic concepts was something that didn't come easy and I still have a lot more to learn on my Django journey.

## 2. User stories

The user stories for this project were written and managed using the agile kanban board function within my GitHub repository [Link here!](https://github.com/MarkReddy87/marks-kitchen/projects/1) 

I found this tool very rewarding. I was able to see my progress as I worked through each user story and moving them across each column after completion was very satisfying. Below is a list of the user stories I created:

As a site user I can view the restaurant menu so that I can see what dishes are available and at what price.
As a site user I can create an account so that I can make and save my booking.
As site admin I can confirm a booking so that I can avoid double booking a table for a specific time.
As a site user I can log into my account so that I can save my details.
As a site user I can contact the restaurant so that I can submit a review or ask a question.
As a site user I can make a booking for one or more people so that I can reserve a table for a specific date and time to have a meal.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Main Site Features

This project is a multi-page Django app. The home page has an eye catching feature image containing a welcome message as well as a sleek responsive navagation bar which is consistant across all pages. The landing page also contains the restaurants full menu for all site visitors to see.

Any site visitor is given the opportunity to register for an account which unlocks further features within the site.

A returning user who is already registered with can navigate to the login page and once the form is completed all the features of the site will be unlocked.

Any unregistered site visitor can navigate to the "see our reviews" page where there is a collection of reviews which have been left by registers users who have had an experience's with Mark's kitchen in the past.

If the user is registered they can login upon returning to the site and navigate to the "make a booking" page where a form will now be unlocked which will take all the necessary details from the user to make a booking in the restaurant.

Once the user has correctly filled out the form the data is submitted and sved to the database where it will await approval from the site admin.

Also if the user is registered they can login and navigate to the "write a review page" where another from will now be unlocked. This form give the user the ability to leave a review of the restaurant and allows them to attach an image of their experience if they wish to do so. If no image is supplied the site will automatically attach a placeholer image for them.

Once the review form is correctly filled out the user will get an alert message telling them the review is awaiting approval and when approved by the admin the users review will appear on the sites "see our reviews" page for any site visitor to see.

The site also has fully responsive footer containing all the social media links, among others, styled with icons from [Font Awsome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Finally the user can sign out of their account from the navigation bar if they wish to do so and will be prompted with a message asking them to confirm. Once confirmed the user is then redirected back to the home page.

### 3.2 Security Features

One of the main security features present in this project is the use of the Cross-Site Request Forgery(csrf) token which is present on all forms across the site. This token is used to send requests to the server and is tied to the user's session allowing the forms to be validated and protect the data against cross-site request forgery.

Another security feature present in this project is the use of a django super user. This is created in the development enviornment with a Username, Email and Password. We type the command "python3 manage.py createsuperuser" into the terminal within the GitHub workspace and follow the prompts to create the account. Once created this gives the user full access to the admin panel of the site allowing them to create, edit and delete data in the database.


## 4. Future Features

When thinking of potential future features to add to this site the possibilities are almost endless because of the versatility of the Django framework and I have only touched the surface of what it can do. 

I would start with an interactive gallery page which contained up to date images of the reataurant premises, menu contents and of the owner / staff with accompanying profiles. This would give the site users a great visual understanding of the restaurant as well a more far personal experience by getting to know the owner and staff without ever having visited the restaurant.

Another feature I would like to add would be a page consisting of a payment system where a user could purchase a voucher for the restaurant which would be automatically sent to their email address and could be used upon arrival. 


## 5. Typography and color scheme

For this site I chose to use a bootstrap theme called "clean blog" which was downloaded from the [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) website. This theme added such value to the site asthetics on so many levels. I wanted a very sleek but simple design which was also very responsive and intuative at the same time and I feel this theme did it all. I modified the html code in theme from its original state and used custom images and CSS to make it my own but the theme helped getting the navigation bar and the footer to look the way I wanted it to. 

I chose to use simple and contrasting colors which I think helps the sites readability and promotes a positive user response. The two [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) I used which I thought paired well together were Lato and Open Sans.

## 6. Wireframes

[Link to Project Wireframes](https://balsamiq.cloud/s1wvfc3/p8hftjs/r1F97).

I found using Balsamiq wireframes very beneficial. This is a great tool to use during the project inception. It allows the user to plan out every page you want to create with great detail and with the variety elements to choose from I feel it can inspire you to come up with new ideas. After creating my wireframes I found myself using them as a constant reference during the coding process.

## 8. Testing

   ### 8.1 code validation

   * HTML - No fatal erros were returned when HTML code was passed through the official [WÂ£C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
   * CSS - No errors were returned when the CSS code was passed through the official [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
   * Python - No errors were returned when the Python code was passed through the [Python Syntax Chacker](https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html)

   Extensive manual testing was done on the finished site to make sure that the data entered into the forms was save correctly to the database and when the data had been approved by the site admin it was then properly displayed on the relevant pages within the site. 
   
   1. Firstly once the app was successfully deployed to heroku I began the resistration process and set up a new account by clicking the register button in the top left of the screen and entering the required information in the form shown on screen. Once registered the user is then redirected to the home page as expected.
   2. Now that I was logged in as a registered user I had full access to all the sites capabilities and would be able to leave a review and make a booking request. Upon clicking the write a review link at the top of the page I could access the review form where I could enter the relevant details and an accompanying picture if chose too. To ensure all the code was working as expected I created two reviews, one with a picture attached and one without. I then logged into the sites admin where I could access the two recent reviews and approve / update each of them. Then back on the site I could navigate to the "see our reviews" page where the two reviews were now shown and I was able to see that the placeholder image was in fact working and present.
   3. Next I tested the booking form. Navigating to the "make a booking" tab shows the booking form where the logged in user can now fill out the required information to make a booking request. While filling this out I noticed a issue with the username field where all the registered users appeared in the dropdown menu and could be accessed by any logged in user. This issue needed to be addressed as this is considered a breach of defensive design. After this issue was removed a user could then submit the form for admin approval and once the button was clicked there were presented with a success message letting them know their form entry was a success. Now navigating to the site admin I could see that the booking had been created and as the site owner I could now approve the booking and contact the customer.

   ### 8.2 fixed bugs

   I came across a number of bugs during the development of this site. One particular case was when I was trying to display the images attached to the user reviews. After building the bootstrap cards to contain each review the images would display too large and were not contained within the cards themselves. After reviewing the bootstrap documentation relating to images I was able to apply the correct class (img-fluid) to the appropriate div elements to solve this issue.

   Another bug that came up was when registering for an account. Once the new account details had been entered and the form was submitted the site gave an internal server error and did not redirect the user back to the home page. To ammend this I added two variables into settings.py which were EMAIL_BACKEND and ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION. After applying both of these the function thankfully worked as intended.

   Another bug I had to tackle was only allowing registered users who were logged in to have access to the sites forms. After reviewing the relevant course content I was able to insert and if/else clause within the html template with an accompanying message prompting the user to sign in / register to gain full access to the site capabilities.

   ### 8.3 supported screens and browsers

   The site was developed and tested with the Goggle Chrome browser.
   The bootstrap theme used in this site included media queries in the CSS file which makes the site fully responsive on all screen sizes by stacking elements on smaller screen widths as well as adding a dropdown menu within the navagation bar to hold all the relevant page links.


## 9. Deployment

### 9.1 via gitpod

This project was built entirely using [Github](https://github.com/) and [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/).
* First I created a repository in my GitHub account and named it appropriately.
* Then I was able to create a GitPod workspace which included the Code Institute template where I was able to write and save all my code progress.

### 9.2 via heroku

This project was deployed as a Python based Django applcation on the Heroku cloud platform.
*  Firstly a new app was created on the Heroku site and named appropriately.
* Once the required packages were installed with the Gitpod workspace and added to the requirements.txt file I could then apply the correct settings to my Heroku app.
* Within the setting tab three different Config Vars were required: Cloudinary for hosting images, Postgres database for hosting all site data and the Secret Key url to hide any sensitive data in my workspace.
* The Gunicorn dyno was then added as well as the Heroku Postgres add-on.
* Once all these steps were done the we can then head to the deploy tab and link the respective GitHub repository to the app and now the project is ready to be built and deployed from the main Github branch.
