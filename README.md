# Mark's Kitchen - A True Culinary Experience

[Please see my live app here!](https://marks-kitchen.herokuapp.com/)

## 1. Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project was to design a website which allowed a user to register for an account, book a meal in a restaurant on a particular date at a particular time and allow all users to post reviews that could be seen by all visitors of the site.

This project was my first time developing with the Django framework and was a huge undertaking for me, grasping the basic concepts was something that didn't come easy and I still have a lot more to learn on my Django journey.

2. User stories

The user stories for this project were written and managed using the agile kanban board function within my GitHub repository [Link here!](https://github.com/MarkReddy87/marks-kitchen/projects/1) 

I found this tool very rewarding. I was able to see my progress as I worked through each user story and moving them across each column after completion was very satisfying. Below is a list of the user stories I created:

As a site user I can view the restaurant menu so that I can see what dishes are available and at what price.
As a site user I can create an account so that I can make and save my booking.
As site admin I can confirm a booking so that I can avoid double booking a table for a specific time.
As a site user I can log into my account so that I can save my details.
As a site user I can contact the restaurant so that I can submit a review or ask a question.
As a site user I can make a booking for one or more people so that I can reserve a table for a specific date and time to have a meal.
